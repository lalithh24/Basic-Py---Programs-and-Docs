#declaring variables and some operations on them

my_int = 5               #declares my_int as an integer data type and assigns a value of 5
my_float = 6.0           #declares my_float as a float data type and assigns a value of 6.0
my_string = "newstring"  #declares my_string as a string data type and assigns a value of 'newstring'

print(my_int)            #displays 5 as output
print(my_float)          #displays 6.0 as output
print(my_string)         #displays newstring as output 

#operators on strings and numbers

# "+" in numbers is mathematical addition

a = 5
b = 6
d,e = 4,40 #can declare simultaneously also
c = a+b+d+e
print("the sum is:",c)

#  "+" in strings is concatenation
string_one = "hello"
string_two = "world"
string_three = string_one + ' ' + string_two
print("the string after concatenation is:" string_three)
